3. Single Sided Band Supressed Carrier Modulation [SSBSC]
4. Frequency Modulation [FM]
5. Pulse Amplitude Modulation [PAM]
6. Pulse Width Modulation [PWM]
7. Pulse Position Modulation [PPM]
8. Pulse Code Modulation [PCM]

# Digital Modulation Techniques:
1. Amplitude Shift Keying [ASK]
2. Frequency Shift Keying [FSK]

# Transformation of Continuous Signal to Discrete Signal
1. Sampling Theorem
